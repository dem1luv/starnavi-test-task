## Description

This repository contains the solution for the StarNavi test task. The project is written in Angular 17, where the user can interact with a grid of squares based on specific rules.

### Task Criteria

To successfully pass the test, ensure the following criteria are met:

1. The app MUST work without errors.
2. Fetch presets for app mode using the endpoint: [https://60816d9073292b0017cdd833.mockapi.io/modes](https://60816d9073292b0017cdd833.mockapi.io/modes). This should be a request to the server and NOT just a copy-paste of data.
3. The data retrieved is an array of objects with a field:
    - `field`: Contains the size of the app field and should be in a square form.

### Work Description

1. User sets the app mode.
2. Press START.
3. If the user hovers over a square, it turns blue.
4. If the user hovers over the blue square, it turns white.

- The result of the work should be a link to the repository.
